## DOTFILES

Files to help set up new computers without faffing around.


# Brew

Install Homebrew first:

```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

Then `brew bundle` to install dependencies from the brewfile.s


# ZSH

Install Oh My Zsh!

```$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"```

And then copy across `.zshrc` to your home directory.
